# Projektarbeit

This project includes TicTacToe implemented in Python and the training of an AI with to use of Reinforcement Learning - to be specific: Q Learning. 

Author: Leonhard Leopold, SWD17

Stauts: Prototype 
The Ai for the TicTacToe works perfectly after only a short time in training. 
Possible Future Tasks: Improving the UI and maybe trying to implement an AI for connect4 with the same stradegy

How to use it:
- Download the code and install python.
- In the command line, type: py tictactoe.py 
- Afterwards you have the option to choose between 3 diffrent modes: 
  - 1. Human vs Human 
  - 2. Human vs AI
  - 3. AI training (AI vs AI)
